# whosonfirst-www-tk

> "To come" is a printing and journalism reference, commonly abbreviated to "TK". It is used to signify that additional material will be added at a later date.

> TK as an abbreviation may originally have come into use because very few words feature this letter combination. The phrase "to come," by contrast, could potentially be mistaken as a deliberate part of the text.
